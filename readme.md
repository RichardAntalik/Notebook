# This is experimental IO board for RPI CM5

The goal here is to design electronics needed for small notebook with 8 inch display.
This is mainly a fun project, excersise in device production capability and integration
of complex systems.

Highly experimental, likely untested in latest revision!

## Features
- Smol
- 2 layer PCB layout! Optimized for home production
- Has integrated power management for 1S lipo pack
- Implements USB, HDMI and PCIe IO

## TODO
- Display interface (will likely use plain DSI with compatible LCD instead of LT6911C over HDMI)
- USB hub for more IO
- Sound interface
- Extension interface
- likely will need to design custom keyboard
